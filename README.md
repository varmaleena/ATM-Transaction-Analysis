# ATM-Transaction-Analysis
Developed an end-to-end interactive Power BI dashboard to monitor and analyze the operational performance of ATMs across multiple states and banks. The dashboard includes detailed KPIs such as Monthly Financial & Non-Financial Transactions, Average Daily Transactions, Revenue Generation, and Maintenance Costs (CRA, MHA, Spare Replacements). Implemented custom DAX measures to calculate metrics like Effective Days, Average Monthly Transactions, and Cost-to-Revenue Ratios, enabling stakeholders to identify underperforming ATMs and optimize site maintenance expenses. Streamlined data modeling and relationship mapping to enhance dashboard refresh speed and accuracy.

The background templates are built using figma.
